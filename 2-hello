Assignment name  : hello
Expected files   : hello.c
Allowed functions: write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that displays "Hello World!" followed by a \n.

Example:

$>./hello
Hello World!
$>./hello | cat -e
Hello World!$
$>

Here's an example implementation of the `hello` program in C:

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    write(1, "Hello World!\n", 13);
    return 0;
}
```

In this program, we include the `<unistd.h>` header file to have access to the `write()` function.

In the `main()` function, we use the `write()` function to write the string `"Hello World!\n"` to the standard output. The first argument `1` represents the file descriptor for the standard output. The second argument is the address of the string, and the third argument `13` is the length of the string (including the newline character).

To compile and run the program, you can use a C compiler such as `gcc`:

```
$ gcc hello.c -o hello
$ ./hello
Hello World!
```

When you execute the program, it displays "Hello World!" followed by a newline character `\n`.

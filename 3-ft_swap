Write a function that swaps the contents of two integers the adresses of which
are passed as parameters.

Your function must be declared as follows:

void	ft_swap(int *a, int *b);

Here's an example implementation of the `ft_swap` function in C:

```c
void ft_swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}
```

In this function, we use pointers to swap the contents of two integers. We declare a temporary variable `temp` to store the value of `*a`. Then, we assign the value of `*b` to `*a` and finally assign the value of `temp` to `*b`, effectively swapping their contents.

To use this function, you can pass the addresses of two integers as arguments:

```c
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    
    printf("Before swapping: x = %d, y = %d\n", x, y);
    
    ft_swap(&x, &y);
    
    printf("After swapping: x = %d, y = %d\n", x, y);
    
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
Before swapping: x = 10, y = 20
After swapping: x = 20, y = 10
```

In the above example, we declare two integers `x` and `y` and initialize them with values 10 and 20 respectively. We then call the `ft_swap` function, passing the addresses of `x` and `y` as arguments. After the swap, the values of `x` and `y` are reversed.
